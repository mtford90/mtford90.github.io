Hi there!

I'm a software developer from Leeds, England however I lived and worked in London for 5 years and recently established a base in New York having attended the awesome [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com).

My interests mainly lie (but are not limited to) front-end development. I've had heavy involvement with Django, Angular, and iOS development and am the author of [Silk](), a comprehensive profiling tool for Django and [Siesta](), an object mapping framework for the browser that targets REST APIs.

I've also worked with Q/KDB+ a time series database whilst working in investment banking. 

I'm opinionated but not attached to any one framework or technology. Different projects have different requirements and the technology world moves so quickly that getting attached is pointless.
