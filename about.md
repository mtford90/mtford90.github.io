Hi there!

I'm a software engineer, originally from Leeds, England.
 
I've lived and worked in London for 5 years and recently established a base in New York having attended the awesome [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com).

My interests mainly lie - but are not limited to - front-end development. I've had involvement with Django, Angular, and iOS development and am the author of [Silk](http://mtford.co.uk/silk/), a comprehensive profiling tool for Django. Most recently I've spent [alot of time with ReactJS](http://mtford.co.uk/red-hot-react/) and have been working on a RESTful object mapper, [Siesta](http://mtford.co.uk/sista/).

I'm opinionated but not attached to any one framework or technology. Different projects have different requirements and the tech world is constantly evolving.
